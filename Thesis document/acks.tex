First and foremost I would like to express my gratitude to my supervisor David Tax, without whose constant advice and challenging attitude this thesis would not be here. A special thanks goes to my family, who supported every decision along the road and made my route possible in the first place. Nonetheless, I cannot thank Lute enough as without him, my time as a student at the faculty of EEMCS would have been much less smooth, pleasant and successful. Finally, I am thankful for the stimulating discussions and collaborations with fellow students over the past few years, and for the enjoyable time I had in Delft with people that became close friends.
