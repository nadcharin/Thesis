This repository comprises the results of my thesis project: 

_Outlier detection in multivariate time series: exploiting reconstructions from random projections._

This work has been produced under supervision of David Tax, at the Pattern Recognition Laboratory of Delft University of Technology.

The contents of this repository are as follows:
- The data used for the analysis of the two proposed Random Projection methods, and real-world experiments. 
- The code that has been used to generate the results following the setup as explained in the thesis. The code comes in the form of four functions:
	- RP_RECON: the original default RP method.
	- RP_RECON_SCALED: the default RP method with back-scaling.
	- RP_RECON_DELTA: the deltaRP method.
	- RP_RECON_DELTA_OFFLINE: the offline version of the deltaRP method.
- The files used to generate the thesis document.
- The digital final version of the thesis.

I officially started my thesis around 20 November 2017 and will defend my work on 20 July 2018 at 9:30 AM.
